## Description

Reliable decentralized exchange (DEX) blockchain - interoperable with other blockchains using Polkadot. The exchange is using a consensus algorithm that solves MEV/frontrunning problems and makes all participants' access to trading opportunities equal.

The design of the blockchain guarantees fixed-fees that provides greater control of trading costs and higher arbitrage opportunity.
Assets on the exchange will serve multiple purposes- at the first iteration, they are the block producerâ€™s stake and exchange liquidity at the same time, and more comes later.

## Build mangata-node locally
- Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) 

### Compilie mangata-node binary and wasms artifacts
- use docker wrapper for cargo to build `mangata-node`

```
./docker-cargo.sh build --release -p mangata-node
```

build artifacts will be placed in `<REPO ROOT>/docker-cargo/release`

### Generate docker image
You can use `build-image.sh` script to build & generate docker image

```
./scripts/build-image.sh mangatasolutions/mangata-node:dev
```

or you can use already compiled build atributes generated in previous step

```
SKIP_BUILD=1 BUILD_DIR=./docker-cargo/release ./scripts/build-image.sh
```

This will generate new local docker image `mangatasolutions/mangata-node:dev`

## Run

In order to run mangata-parachain locally one need to set up both:
- local relay network
- local parachain network

Because of number of parameters is quite troublesome thats why we came up with dedicated dockerized environment.

### Set up network using parachain-launch

Dockerized setup requires you to build development docker image [mangatasolutions/mangata-node:dev](#generate-docker-image).

Start docker environment using, you need to 

```bash
cd ./launch
yarn install
yarn gen
yarn up
```

once started, you can access nodes using port forwards
- [127.0.0.1:9944](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9946#/explorer) - relaychain 1st collator
- [127.0.0.1:9945](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9946#/explorer) - relaychain 2nd collator
- [127.0.0.1:9946](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9946#/explorer) - parachain 1st collator
- [127.0.0.1:9947](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9946#/explorer) - parachain 2nd collator

Docker setup can be stopped using 

```bash
cd ./launch
yarn down
```

### Sudo access
`Alice` is set as sudo account for parachain-launch docker setup

## Managata node configuration

There is number of chain configurations available for both development and production environements:

| chainspec (`--chain`)         |      Sudo      |  Description                     |
|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `kusama`                      |    *******     | production kusama public mainnet |
| `kusama-local`                |     Alice      | development kusama local testnet |
| `rococo`                      |    *******     | production rococo public testnet |
| `rococo-local`                |     Alice      | development rococo local testnet |
